-- 1) Extend the unassigned-leads bucket to expose the JD keyword and the most
--    recent AI-call summary/disposition. Counsellors keep mis-bucketing JD
--    school enquiries because the keyword that actually drove the lead (and
--    the AI call transcript summary) aren't visible on the bucket card — so
--    a parent asking about MBA who lands under "Cbse Schools" looks
--    indistinguishable from an actual CBSE enquiry.
--
-- 2) Reclassify two JD category mappings that were marked is_school=true but
--    aren't really school categories. They were pulling non-school leads
--    into the CBSE bucket.
